/// @file draining_state.cpp
/// @brief Tests that ChannelManager correctly propagates DRAINING state
///
/// Bug: The rename from ChannelEngine→ChannelDriver changed all
/// EngineState::DRAINING returns to DriverState::BUSY in concrete drivers.
/// Additionally, ChannelManager::poll() never propagated DRAINING state -
/// it only checked for BUSY and ERROR, treating DRAINING as READY.
///
/// The state machine contract is: READY → BUSY → DRAINING → READY
/// - BUSY: Driver is actively processing (encoding, queuing to hardware)
/// - DRAINING: All data submitted to hardware DMA, CPU is free
/// - READY: Hardware idle, safe to start next frame
///
/// onEndFrame() calls waitForReadyOrDraining() which should return as soon
/// as the driver reaches DRAINING (DMA in-flight, CPU free). If DRAINING is
/// lost (mapped to BUSY), onEndFrame() blocks for the full transmission
/// duration, starving WebSockets and other tasks.
