/// @file channel_driver.h
/// @brief Minimal interface for LED channel transmission drivers
///
/// This pure interface defines the contract for LED channel drivers without
/// imposing any specific state management or batching strategy. Concrete
/// implementations handle their own internal state as needed.
///
/// Design Philosophy:
/// - Pure interface: No state management, no helper methods
/// - Three operations: enqueue(), show(), poll()
/// - Flexible: Implementations decide when/how to batch and transmit
/// - Composable: Easy to delegate and wrap (e.g., ChannelManager)
///
/// Migration from ChannelEngine:
/// The old ChannelEngine base class managed shared state (mPendingChannels,
/// mTransmittingChannels, mLastError) which complicated delegation patterns.
/// This interface leaves all state management to concrete implementations.

/// @brief Minimal interface for LED channel transmission drivers
///
/// Pure interface with no state management. Concrete implementations
/// handle their own batching, error tracking, and cleanup logic.
///
/// State Machine Behavior:
/// Typical flow: READY → BUSY → DRAINING → READY
///
/// Usage Pattern:
/// 1. Call enqueue() one or more times to submit LED data
/// 2. Call show() to trigger transmission
/// 3. Call poll() to check transmission status and perform cleanup
///
/// Implementation Guidelines:
/// - enqueue(): Store channel data for later transmission
/// - show(): Initiate transmission of enqueued data (may block if BUSY/DRAINING)
/// - poll(): Return current hardware state and perform cleanup when complete
