/// @file manager.h
/// @brief Unified manager for channel drivers with priority-based fallback
///
/// The ChannelManager coordinates multiple channel drivers (e.g., PARLIO, SPI, RMT)
/// and automatically selects the best available driver based on priority.
/// It acts as a transparent proxy using the Proxy/Decorator pattern - strip drivers
/// interact with it through the ChannelDriver interface without knowing about
/// the manager's existence.
///
/// Design Pattern: Proxy/Decorator
/// - Manager IS A ChannelDriver (inheritance for polymorphic use)
/// - Forwards calls to active driver
/// - Handles fallback automatically
/// - Strip drivers unaware of manager's existence
///
/// Usage Pattern:
/// 1. Platform-specific code builds and configures manager with drivers
/// 2. Strip drivers obtain manager reference: mDriver = &ChannelManager::instance()
/// 3. Manager transparently selects best available driver
/// 4. Automatic fallback when driver allocation fails
/// 5. Per-frame reset allows driver re-evaluation
